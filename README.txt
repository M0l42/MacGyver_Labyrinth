This is my code for the third project of my path "DÃ©veloppeur d'application - Python/Django"
It's a little labyrinth where MacGyver need to escape, for his mission he need to pick up 3 items :
-A needle
-some ether
-A tube
With this he'll be able to make a syringe to put asleep the guard.
Good Luck and Have Fun

I recommend to use a virtual environment for this.

The version needed to play :

Python version : 3.7.3
Pygame version : 1.9.5

You need to install the module needed and have python updated,
you can install the module with requirements.txt :
pip install -r requirements.txt

Note : The sounds is used only on Windows, for some reason pygame.mixer make the game crashed on linux.
So for the moment it will be disable until I find another music's library
because I'd like to find something User's friendly and without having to install any package.
If you know any good music library on python, feel free to contact me :)
