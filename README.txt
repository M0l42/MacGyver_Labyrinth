This is my code for the third project of my path "DÃ©veloppeur d'application - Python/Django"
It's a little labyrinth where MacGyver need to escape, for his mission he need to pick up 3 items :
-A needle
-some ether
-A tube
With this he'll be able to make a syringe to put asleep the guard.
Good Luck and Have Fun
